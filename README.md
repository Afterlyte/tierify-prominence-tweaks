# Tierify modification datapack for Prominence II RPG

This is a datapack that tweaks values across the board for the Tierify mod, which adds rarity tiers and stat buffs/debuffs to equipment in the modpack. The goal of this datapack is to smooth out values across the board so they feel more logical and progressive, while keeping their original max values intact.

Feel free to use this in your own modpack as well if you like the values I've created here!
